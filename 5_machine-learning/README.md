### AWS Machine Learning Resources

- READ main **AWS ML blog** at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/
- WORK with training from **AWS ML Team** at https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/mlu/ 
    - NLP, Tabular Data or Computer Vision scenarios
- PRACTICE using any of of a large number of **AWS SageMaker Jupyter notebook** examples
    - create a AWS SageMaker Notebook instance 
    - connect to Jupyter
    - navigate to the `SageMaker Examples` tab your SageMaker notebook instance
    - The URL will look something like this - https://demo.notebook.us-east-1.sagemaker.aws/tree#examples
    - Shown below is a screenshot of example notebook categories available
