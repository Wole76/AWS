# AWS Lake House Architecture

from - https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/lake-house-architecture/

The amount of data generated by IoT, smart devices, cloud applications, and social is growing exponentially. You need ways to easily and cost-effectively analyze all of this data with minimal time-to-insight, regardless of the format or where the data is stored.  

Amazon Redshift powers the lake house architecture â€“ enabling you to query data across your data warehouse, data lake, and operational databases to gain faster and deeper insights not possible otherwise. With a lake house architecture, you can store data in open file formats in your Amazon S3 data lake. This allows you to make this data available easily to other analytics and machine learning tools rather than locking it in a new silo.  

With an Amazon Redshift lake house architecture, you can:  

- Easily query data in your data lake and write data back to your data lake in open formats.
- Use familiar SQL statements to combine and process data across all your data stores.
- Execute queries on live data in your operational databases without requiring any data loading and ETL pipelines.
